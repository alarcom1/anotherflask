                    For my project I used bootstrap v5 for css. I have a yml file that pushes my project image to
                    heroku twice. One for Dev and one for Prod as a design.

                <h1>GitHub Actions</h1>
                <p>
                    In my website project under the ".github/workflows" folder I have a dev.yml and a prod.yml that is synchronized with a heroku deploy
                    API that I have setup in my Github repository. In Github settings > secrets > actions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my flask website application I use the "CI/CD" process using GitHub actions that when my master branch is updated, pushed, or pull requested,
                     it triggers a workflow to update the heroku prod and dev app
                </p>
                <p>
                    In PyCharm services terminal, I run a "pytest" that runs through a series of checks I have specified in "simple_pages_test.py" python file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Badges for production workflow and development workflow are displayed in my github repository specified on the "Readme.MD" file.
                </p>

                <h1>Code Review</h1>
                <p>
                    In GitHub Actions Workflows, I display a series of workflows that run through test checks specified in my .yml files that runtests,
                    build containers, and deploys. In summary, the tests;
                    <ul>
                <li>set up job</li>
                <li>run actions/checkout</li>
                <li>set up python 3.8</li>
                <li>install dependencies</li>
                <li>test with pytest</li>
                <li>post run actions/checkout@v2</li>
                <li>complete job</li>
            </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am able to deploy an image of my project to Dockerhub when my master branch is updated to GitHub because of
                    the prod.yml file with the build container, runs on, and steps. Configurations where I specified the dockerhub
                    image, login, and deploy commands.
